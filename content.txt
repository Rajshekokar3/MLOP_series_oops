1. Class and object(example)
2. class has data/attribute and func/method
    > Code walkthrough
    > Atribute get celled itself,methods are called manually
3. why python is called OOPS --> everything in python is an object (data structure ,data type etc)
4. Advantages of oops concept 
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to End project(Chatbookclass)
    > function vs methods
    > dundar method
    > self
    > we can create attribut outside class
    
    
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter # to get the hidden attribut and to set the attribute
    > static method

    > Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example 
    > why inheritance is need?(code reusibility,parent has no acces to child class) 
    > what gets inherited? -Constructor,Non private attribute ,Non private methods
    > Construction overloading and method overloading
    > Super keyword(can be used only inside class ,can not access varibles/attributes, used only inside class )

    >Type of inheritance -1. Single inheritance | 2 .Multilevel | 3. Hieracical inheritance | 4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5 .Hybrid
