1. Class and object(example)
2. class has data/attribute and func/method
    > Code walkthrough
    > Atribute get celled itself,methods are called manually
3. why python is called OOPS --> everything in python is an object (data structure ,data type etc)
4. Advantages of oops concept 
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to End project(Chatbookclass)
    > function vs methods
    > dundar method
    > self
    > we can create attribut outside class
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter # to get the hidden attribut and to set the attribute
    > static method
